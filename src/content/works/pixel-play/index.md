For the MDEF transfrontalier research residency and exhibition, Playing with Pixels was presented by the artist Emmanuelle Pangilinan (Minnie) @kotsengkuba

Drawing inspiration from various sources such as snow, jam sessions, and the interplay between nature and digital realms, Playing with Pixels was conceived as a program designed to interactively manipulate live image streams. The crux of the concept revolved around the "greenness" of the view, interpreted through the RGB values, which translated into melodic tones. This exploration aimed to capture the essence of nature through simplistic visual representations, triggering harmonious audio responses. Notably, the melodic compositions were aligned with the musical scale of the artist's kalimba, facilitating a human-nature-tech interaction and impromptu music jam sessions.

Coming from the Philippines, during her residency, Minnie saw snow for the first time in her life. In the process of coding and refining the application, an unexpected discovery emerged: a visual effect reminiscent of snow gradually accumulating on each frame of the video feed. The artist opted to integrate this effect into the project, adding a very personal layer.
