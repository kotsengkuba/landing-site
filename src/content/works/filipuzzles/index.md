A small local enterprise in the Philippines, Cut N Shape Mfg., partnered with our group from the Industrial Design program to design new products. After conducting profiling and market research, we developed Filipuzzlesâ€”collections of flat-pack 3D wooden puzzles designed to raise awareness about Philippine fauna.
