This toy is inspired by Star Trek, which I started watching during the pandemic. I found the Bird-of-Prey Klingon vessel to have a good shape for a balancing toy. A throwback to my highschool physics class project!

To achieve this floating-like but stable state, the center of mass should be at or below the point where you want it to balance. Thatâ€™s why the coins are needed.
