Reflecting on the state of the world and the state of being in it and in-betweens. We live in deep interconnections that many seem to have taken for granted. La Banda del Patio is a three-person collective, Minnie, Ana and Nicolo.
We apply circuit bending, glitching, hardware hacking and similar techniques to create auditory and visual instruments.
JALEO is our debut project presented during Alquimia, a self-organized culminating festival for the master program. This is a collection of prototypes from toys and found objects, opened up, exposed, re-valued and ready to be
played.

## Manifesto
> << We are living in-between as being a presence in the present: staying in between is a process of Transform-Action, a dynamic happening of alchemy. It’s oscillating across dichotomies to find rebirth, the rebirth of meaning, experiencing, feeling.
>
> The Transform-Action itself is a process of rebirthing.
> 
> The presence in the present is a gathering space to feel safe and take care (of), where choosing and imperfections are allowed because it is ever-changing. It’s a humble and hopeful belief that this space can grow exactly here in symbiosis.
> 
> Being in-between does not mean to find a margin and choose a point on this line, but moving freely in a grey area not clearly defined. It’s not only guided by knowledge and rationality, but also by instinct, feel and sense.
> 
> The starting point to reach this grey area is material, tangible, but at the same time ready to be reconsidered through virtuality. >>
